# *Move-Duck* Service

This demo implements the *move-duck* service that requires a starting point from which the duck will be picked up and a destination point to which the duck will be moved. The points must be given by the consumer in relative coordinates that are calculated from a reference point that the robot also knows in its own coordinate system.
