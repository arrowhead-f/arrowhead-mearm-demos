# Arrowhead MeArm Demos

This repository contains Arrowhead demo services for the [MeArm](https://mearm.com/) robotic arm. The service implementations presented here are based on the ArrowheadESP library and the Arrowhead Adapter codebase. (These are Arduino programs that are written primarily for the ESP8266 microcontroller.)

## Requirements

In order to compile these demos (e.g. in Arduino IDE), you will need the following libraries:

* [ESP8266 Arduino Core](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) or [ESP32 Arduino Core](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) if you are compiling to ESP microcontrollers
* [ArrowheadESP](https://github.com/arrowhead-f/ArrowheadESP)
* [Arrowhead Adapter](https://github.com/bazileos/adapter-quick-demo-dev)
* [MeArm](https://github.com/yorkhackspace/meArm)

## Arrowhead configuration

In order to set up the Arrowhead adapter for your robotic arm please refer to the documentation found in [this repository](https://github.com/bazileos/adapter-quick-demo-dev)
